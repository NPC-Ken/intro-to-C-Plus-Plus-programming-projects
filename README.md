# Intro to C++ Programming Projects

This repository contains a collection of C++ projects developed during my *CSP 360: Introduction to Programming* course in Spring 2025. Each project demonstrates foundational programming concepts, object-oriented principles, and practical problem-solving skills using C++ and Visual Studio.

## üß† Overview

The projects in this repository cover a range of topics, including:

* **Control Structures**: Utilization of loops (`for`, `while`), conditional statements (`if`, `switch`), and nested structures.
* **Functions**: Implementation of reusable code blocks with parameters and return values.
* **Arrays and Pointers**: Manipulation of data using arrays and dynamic memory allocation with pointers.
* **Object-Oriented Programming**: Creation of classes, objects, and encapsulation of data and behaviors.
* **File I/O**: Reading from and writing to files for data persistence.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The repository includes the following files and directories:

* `ZooProject/`: A comprehensive project simulating a zoo management system.
* `CSP 360 Labs.vcxproj` & `CSP 360 Labs.vcxproj.filters`: Visual Studio project and filter files.
* `DogClassescpp.cpp`: Demonstrates class creation and object manipulation.
* `DynamicArrays.cpp`: Explores dynamic memory allocation and array resizing.
* `Loops.cpp` & `NestedLoops.cpp`: Examples of loop constructs and nested loops.
* `PaintJob.cpp`: Calculates the cost of a painting job based on user input.
* `PizzaCalculator.cpp`: Determines pizza sizes and costs.
* `PointerArrays.cpp` & `Pointers.cpp`: Illustrate pointer usage and pointer arithmetic.
* `Product.cpp` & `Product.h`: Defines a `Product` class with associated methods.
* `QuizScoring.cpp`: Scores a quiz based on correct answers.
* `RandomStats.cpp`: Generates random numbers and computes statistics.
* `Receipt.cpp`: Simulates a receipt generation system.
* `CorrectAnswers.txt`, `Proverb.txt`, `Random.txt`: Text files used for file I/O operations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To run these projects:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NPC-Ken/intro-to-C-Plus-Plus-programming-projects.git
   ```
2. **Open with Visual Studio**:

   * Navigate to the cloned directory.
   * Open the `CSP 360 Labs.vcxproj` file with Visual Studio.
3. **Build and Run**:

   * Build the solution to compile the projects.
   * Run individual `.cpp` files to see the output.

## üéØ Purpose

These projects were developed to reinforce programming concepts taught during the course. They serve as practical applications of theoretical knowledge, aiding in the transition from novice to proficient C++ programmer.([GitHub][1])
